# Project 5

# Dimension Reduction and Laplacian Embedding   
<br/><br/>On AT&T400 and Hand-written-letters image data,

* Do PCA to reduce to 10,20,30,50,100 PCA dimensions. 
* Do Linear Discriminant Analysis to reduce to K-1 dimension. 
* Do Laplacian embedding of the data in 5, 10, 20, 30, 50 dimensions 
* Do cross-validation on the transformed (reduced) data using SVM and Centroid, Linear Regression
